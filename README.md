# Line Movement

Similar to my stock tracker project, this project is also meant to practice fetching data with API's. Another type of information that is useful to me is tracking the information for sports betting purposes. This project is meant to track the movement of the spread for NFL games throughout the week leading up to a matchup.

Tracking line movement can give you a good idea of where the majority of money is being wagered for a sporting event, because sportsbooks will constantly adjust the spread to ensure that they are getting equal amounts of money on both sides of the spread they come up with.
